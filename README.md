# FoodApp

Embark into a flavorful journey with a mobile app I crafted using Flutter & Dart. Born from my coding adventures as I first delved into the world of Flutter, 
this app reshapes how we explore culinary delights. From discovering top spots to browsing delicious menus, it's your go-to destination for dining excellence.
